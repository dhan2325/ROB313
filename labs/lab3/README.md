#Python Setup Instructions
While it is not included in the zip submission as per the instructions, the folder provided for the data utility functions should be included in the directory from which the python files will be run (files import the load_dataset function). As for external libraries, the two python files make use of numpy for linear algebra computations and vectorization purposes, matplotlib to generate graphs, and some standard python libraries to perform miscellaneous tasks, so scripts should be run in an environment where all the aforementioned libraries are available.

Note that while the classes in the two scripts look similar, they have notably different class methods tailored to the two optimization problems being solved.
